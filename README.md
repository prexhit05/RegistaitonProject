I am pleased to inform you that I have successfully completed the task of creating the web application using SpringBoot, Hibernate, MySQL, HTML and ThymeLeaf. 
Below are the details of the deliverables:

**Employee Registration Page:**
I have created a registration page with fields for Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Address, City, State, Login ID, and Password.

**Login Page:**
The login functionality has been implemented, allowing users to access the application securely.

**Welcome Page:**
A welcome page displays a personalized greeting message to the logged-in user by name.

**Database Page/Employee List Page:**
I have included a page that lists all registered users stored in the database.
